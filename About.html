        <h5>About Me</h5>
        <p>I am a proud alumnus of Ananda College in Colombo, where I completed my Ordinary Level (O/L) and studies with a focus on the mathematics stream for Advanced Level (A/L) examinations. My journey at Ananda College not only equipped me with a strong academic foundation but also fostered my personal and leadership growth.
            During my time at Ananda College, I discovered my passion for rugby, a sport that taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork, discipline, and resilience. Serving as the vice-captain of the rugby team in 2017 and 2018 was a defining experience that honed my leadership skills and instilled in me a deep sense of responsibility..</p>

        <h5></h5>
        <p>Building upon my passion for technology, I pursued a BSc (Hons) in Software Engineering at CINEC Campus, where I delved into various aspects of software development. Through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, I gained proficiency in programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, PHP, CSS, React, and .NET.
            Moreover, I developed a solid understanding of essential concepts in software engineering, including graph theory, data structures and algorithms, database management (SQL, MySQL), and software project management methodologies (Agile, Waterfall, Prototype architectures). This knowledge equipped me with the skills necessary to design, develop, and manage complex software systems effectively.</p>

        <p>Concurrently, I pursued a BSc (Hons) in Applied Accounting at CA Sri Lanka, where I gained valuable insights into accounting standards (LKAS, SLFRS), cost management, and business finance. While my passion lies in software engineering, I recognize the importance of financial literacy and its relevance in the business world.</p>
